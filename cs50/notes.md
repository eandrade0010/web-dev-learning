# Week 2

## Problem Set 'Viginere'
Consider the text:  
'Eddie'  
and a keyword:  
'ABC'

The keyword will be convereted to integer values and repeat as necessary until the length of the text is met.  
It is preferred that a range of 'a' to 'z' be used and cycled through as necessary. It is quite easy to do so. I.e.,
```
shifter = some_value
flag = 0
if char is upper: flag = 1
If shift > 26:
  shifter = shifter%26;
char = char + shifter;
if flag:
  char to upper
```
